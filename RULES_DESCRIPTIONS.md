## add-constant

_Description_: Suggests using constant for [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Unnamed_numerical_constants) and string literals.

_Configuration_:

* `maxLitCount` : (string) maximum number of instances of a string literal that are tolerated before warn.
* `allowStr`: (string) comma-separated list of allowed string literals
* `allowInts`: (string) comma-separated list of allowed integers
* `allowFloats`: (string) comma-separated list of allowed floats

Example:

```toml
[rule.add-constant]
  arguments = [{maxLitCount = "3",allowStrs ="\"\"",allowInts="0,1,2",allowFloats="0.0,0.,1.0,1.,2.0,2."}]
```

## argument-limit

_Description_: Warns when a function receives more parameters than the maximum set by the rule's configuration.
Enforcing a maximum number of parameters helps to keep the code readable and maintainable.

_Configuration_: (int) the maximum number of parameters allowed per function.

Example:

```toml
[rule.argument-limit]
  arguments =[4]
```

## atomic

_Description_: Check for commonly mistaken usages of the `sync/atomic` package

_Configuration_: N/A

## blank-imports

_Description_: Blank import should be only in a main or test package, or have a comment justifying it.

_Configuration_: N/A

## bool-literal-in-expr

_Description_: Using Boolean literals (`true`, `false`) in logic expressions may make the code less readable. This rule suggests removing Boolean literals from logic expressions.

_Configuration_: N/A

## call-to-gc

_Description_:  Explicitly invoking the garbage collector is, except for specific uses in benchmarking, very dubious.

The garbage collector can be configured through environment variables as described [here](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/).

_Configuration_: N/A

## confusing-naming

_Description_: Methods or fields of `struct` that have names different only by capitalization could be confusing.

_Configuration_: N/A

## confusing-results

_Description_: Function or methods that return multiple, no named, values of the same type could induce error.

_Configuration_: N/A

## constant-logical-expr

_Description_: The rule spots logical expressions that evaluate always to the same value.

_Configuration_: N/A

## context-as-argument

_Description_: By [convention](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#contexts), `context.Context` should be the first parameter of a function. This rule spots function declarations that do not follow the convention.

_Configuration_: N/A

## context-keys-type

_Description_: Basic types should not be used as a key in `context.WithValue`.

_Configuration_: N/A

## cyclomatic

_Description_: [Cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity) is a measure of code complexity. Enforcing a maximum complexity per function helps to keep code readable and maintainable.

_Configuration_: (int) the maximum function complexity

Example:

```toml
[rule.cyclomatic]
  arguments =[3]
```

## deep-exit

_Description_: Packages exposing functions that can stop program execution by exiting are hard to reuse. This rule looks for program exits in functions other than `main()` or `init()`.

_Configuration_: N/A

## dot-imports

_Description_: Importing with `.` makes the programs much harder to understand because it is unclear whether names belong to the current package or to an imported package.

More information [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#import-dot)

_Configuration_: N/A

## duplicated-imports

_Description_: It is possible to unintentionally import the same package twice. This rule looks for packages that are imported two or more times.

_Configuration_: N/A

## empty-block

_Description_: Empty blocks make code less readable and could be a symptom of a bug or unfinished refactoring.

_Configuration_: N/A

## empty-lines

_Description_: Sometimes `gofmt` is not enough to enforce a common formatting of a code-base; this rule warns when there are heading or trailing newlines in code blocks.

_Configuration_: N/A

## error-naming

_Description_: By convention, for the sake of readability, variables of type `error` must be named with the prefix `err`.

_Configuration_: N/A

## error-return

_Description_: By convention, for the sake of readability, the errors should be last in the list of returned values by a function.

_Configuration_: N/A

## error-strings

_Description_: By convention, for better readability, error messages should not be capitalized or end with punctuation or a newline.

More information [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#error-strings)

_Configuration_: N/A

## errorf

_Description_: It is possible to get a simpler program by replacing `errors.New(fmt.Sprintf())` with `fmt.Errorf()`. This rule spots that kind of simplification opportunities.

_Configuration_: N/A

## exported

_Description_: Exported function and methods should have comments. This warns on undocumented exported functions and methods.

More information [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#doc-comments)

_Configuration_: N/A

## file-header

_Description_: This rule helps to enforce a common header for all source files in a project by spotting those files that do not have the specified header.

_Configuration_: (string) the header to look for in source files.

Example:

```toml
[rule.file-header]
  arguments =["This is the text that must appear at the top of source files."]
```

## flag-parameter

_Description_: If a function controls the flow of another by passing it information on what to do, both functions are said to be [control-coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)#Procedural_programming).
Coupling among functions must be minimized for better maintainability of the code.
This rule warns on boolean parameters that create a control coupling.

_Configuration_: N/A

## function-result-limit

_Description_: Functions returning too many results can be hard to understand/use.

_Configuration_: (int) the maximum allowed return values

Example:

```toml
[rule.function-result-limit]
  arguments =[3]
```

## get-return

_Description_: Typically, functions with names prefixed with _Get_ are supposed to return a value.

_Configuration_: N/A

## if-return

_Description_: Checking if an error is _nil_ to just after return the error or nil is redundant.

_Configuration_: N/A

## increment-decrement

_Description_: By convention, for better readability, incrementing an integer variable by 1 is recommended to be done using the `++` operator.
This rule spots expressions  like `i += 1` and `i -= 1` and proposes to change them into `i++` and `i--`.

_Configuration_: N/A

## indent-error-flow

_Description_: To improve the readability of code, it is recommended to reduce the indentation as much as possible.
This rule highlights redundant _else-blocks_ that can be eliminated from the code.

More information [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#indent-error-flow)

_Configuration_: N/A

## imports-blacklist

_Description_: Warns when importing black-listed packages.

_Configuration_: black-list of package names

Example:

```toml
[imports-blacklist]
  arguments =["crypto/md5", "crypto/sha1"]
```
### import-shadowing

_Description_: In GO it is possible to declare identifiers (packages, structs, 
interfaces, parameters, receivers, variables, constants...) that conflict with the 
name of an imported package. This rule spots identifiers that shadow an import.

_Configuration_: N/A

## line-length-limit

_Description_: Warns in the presence of code lines longer than a configured maximum.

_Configuration_: (int) maximum line length in characters.

Example:

```toml
[rule.line-length-limit]
  arguments =[80]
```

## max-public-structs

_Description_: Packages declaring too many public structs can be hard to understand/use,
and could be a symptom of bad design.

This rule warns on files declaring more than a configured, maximum number of public structs.

_Configuration_: (int) the maximum allowed public structs

Example:

```toml
[rule.max-public-structs]
  arguments =[3]
```

## modifies-parameter

_Description_: A function that modifies its parameters can be hard to understand. It can also be misleading if the arguments are passed by value by the caller.
This rule warns when a function modifies one or more of its parameters.

_Configuration_: N/A

## modifies-value-receiver

_Description_: A method that modifies its receiver value can have undesired behavior. The modification can be also the root of a bug because the actual value receiver could be a copy of that used at the calling site.
This rule warns when a method modifies its receiver.

_Configuration_: N/A

## package-comments

_Description_: Packages should have comments. This rule warns on undocumented packages and when packages comments are detached to the `package` keyword.

More information [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#package-comments)

_Configuration_: N/A

## range

_Description_: This rule suggests a shorter way of writing ranges that do not use the second value.

_Configuration_: N/A

## range-val-in-closure

_Description_: Range variables in a loop are reused at each iteration; therefore a goroutine created in a loop will point to the range variable with from the upper scope. This way, the goroutine could use the variable with an undesired value.
This rule warns when a range value (or index) is used inside a closure

_Configuration_: N/A

## receiver-naming

_Description_: By convention, receiver names in a method should reflect their identity. For example, if the receiver is of type `Parts`, `p` is an adequate name for it. Contrary to other languages, it is not idiomatic to name receivers as `this` or `self`.

_Configuration_: N/A

## redefines-builtin-id

_Description_: Constant names like `false`, `true`, `nil`, function names like `append`, `make`, and basic type names like `bool`, and `byte` are not reserved words of the language; therefore the can be redefined.
Even if possible, redefining these built in names can lead to bugs very difficult to detect.

_Configuration_: N/A

## struct-tag

_Description_: Struct tags are not checked at compile time.
This rule, checks and warns if it finds errors in common struct tags types like: asn1, default, json, protobuf, xml, yaml.

_Configuration_: N/A

## superfluous-else

_Description_: To improve the readability of code, it is recommended to reduce the indentation as much as possible.
This rule highlights redundant _else-blocks_ that can be eliminated from the code.

_Configuration_: N/A

## time-naming

_Description_: Using unit-specific suffix like "Secs", "Mins", ... when naming variables of type `time.Duration` can be misleading, this rule highlights those cases.

_Configuration_: N/A

## var-naming

_Description_: This rule warns when [variable](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#variable-names) or [package](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#package-names) naming conventions are not followed.

_Configuration_: This rule accepts two slices of strings, a whitelist and a blacklist of initialisms. By default, the rule behaves exactly as the alternative in `golint` but optionally, you can relax it (see [golint/lint/issues/89](https://github.com/golang/lint/issues/89))

Example:

```toml
[rule.var-naming]
  arguments = [["ID"], ["VM"]]
```

## var-declaration

_Description_: This rule proposes simplifications of variable declarations.

_Configuration_: N/A

## unexported-return

_Description_: This rule warns when an exported function or method returns a value of an un-exported type.

_Configuration_: N/A

## unnecessary-stmt

_Description_: This rule suggests to remove redundant statements like a `break` at the end of a case block, for improving the code's readability.

_Configuration_: N/A

## unreachable-code

_Description_: This rule spots and proposes to remove [unreachable code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreachable_code).

_Configuration_: N/A

## unused-parameter

_Description_: This rule warns on unused parameters. Functions or methods with unused parameters can be a symptom of an unfinished refactoring or a bug.

_Configuration_: N/A

## waitgroup-by-value

_Description_: Function parameters that are passed by value, are in fact a copy of the original argument. Passing a copy of a `sync.WaitGroup` is usually not what the developer wants to do.
This rule warns when a `sync.WaitGroup` expected as a by-value parameter in a function or method.

_Configuration_: N/A
